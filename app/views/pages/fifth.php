                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            Cooperation profiles give you the opportunity to publish and promote your collaboration wishes before and after the event.</li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            Event participants but also any other web user can find and read your organisation details and your published cooperation wishes.</li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            A statistical analysis of 500 matchmaking events showed that high quality profiles are visited about 50 to 150 times.</li>

                            <strong>The better your profile the more meetings requests you will receive at the end.</strong></li>

                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
                        How does the matchmaking work?</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">
                        At a matchmaking event people meet and greet at high speed. Bilateral meetings take usually 20 or 30 minutes, which is usually enough to forge business/research/technological connections. Then the bell rings and the next meeting starts.</div>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">
                        &nbsp;</div>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">
                        Each participant registers with a cooperation profile which will be displayed at the event website. Each participant can online select meetings with other participants they would like to personally talk to. A few days before the event, each participant will receive a meeting schedule, showing WHO he will meet WHEN and WHERE.</div>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">
                        &nbsp;</div>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">
                        What are the benefits of participating in the matchmaking event?</div>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">
                        &nbsp;</div>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">
                        All participants can present their expertise/projects/technologies online already BEFORE the event. The cooperation profiles will be extensively promoted. Participants can get in contact with each other already before the event and know exactly who they will meet at the event. A matchmaking event therefore presents a very<em> efficient and focused</em> way of finding new collaboration partners.</div>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;">
                        &nbsp;</div>
